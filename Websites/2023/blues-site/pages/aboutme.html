        I'm 16yo, having birthday in august, studying IT at high school. I have some expierience of modding some games, finding exploits and creating automation bots. I'm from Czechia. In  my free time I like to code, go outside, finding geocaches or just walking around. I have a few pets, my favorite one being my tomcats. I like the color blue or black and my nickname "blue" is from a tv show i used to watch with my lil sister, called Winx Club. I wanted to make some games with coding, that was my intention to start coding. Thanks for reading this hella long paragraph and have a nice day! :D
